## General Information:
This is a  Data science case study that uses the Lending club historical data to predict the loan defaults among customers.
An approach of exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used for this case study.

Business Objective:
   - A consumer finance company **Lending Club** wants to identify risky loan applicants based on historical data of applicants.
   - They want to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
   - The company can then use this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment ,which will help them to reduce sanctioning such
     loans & thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss

Problem statement:
   - Identification of such Variables/Factors which are strong indicators of loan default loss.

Dataset for the project:
  - loan.csv with historical data of Lending Club
